# Agentic AI Design Patterns


Agentic AI is a type of AI that can operate independently, making decisions and taking actions. Agentic AI systems used LLM to analyze data, identify patterns, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Key Charactersitcs agents have is there ability to dynamically plan and execute task by using external tools. 

But question is how to build a robuts and effective agentic system. Let's look into some common design patterns used for building Agentic AI applications. Let's deep dive each one of them: 


- **Reflection Pattern**: Agent generates a draft solution, and then evaluate it's own output uses that feedback to revive its response iteratively until it produces the final response.
